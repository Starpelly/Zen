# Zen
![githubbanner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27413220-6b70-44b2-92ce-927b96c41dff)
Zen is an imperative scripting language that compiles to human-readable [C99](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C99).

### Hello World
```
using System;

namespace Program;

public fun void Main()
{
    Console::WriteLine("Hello from Zen!");
}
```

## Motivation
Zen attempts to be "nice to look at" by my subjective standards. I take aesthetics pretty seriously, and when I can feel "zen" looking at my code, it makes me happy and thus, more productive.

Zen is mostly a "toy language". As in, it shouldn't be used outside simple game scripting for simple video games.
